# Virtual-Computer

## Introduction

A month ago, I started thinking about making an OS, I wanted to learn how they were made.  
After spending some time researching, I found that I had some compatibility error.  
To fix this, I decided to make my own virtual computer.  

## Installation/Usage

1. Download the files from src folder or from release.

2. Go to the directory where the files are using command-line and run `make`.  

3. The code is now compiled. Run `./cpu` and see the _magic_ happen.
